        <p>
            Porcini mushrooms in South Africa are split into 3 sub-species of the boletus group, Boletus Edulis, Boletus Aereus and Boletus Reticulatis. Boletus Edulis being the most common throughout the season, whereas Boletus Aereus grows mostly during wetter and much cooler conditions, it is commonly found with oak and is known to have a sweeter nuttier flavor than the others. Boletus Reticulatis usually has strong reticulated veins/patterns on the stipe and is known to show up in warmer weather, hence the name Summer Cep as you may find these on hot summer days even.
        </p>
        <p>  Known across the globe for its deep, nutty flavour and meaty texture, the Porcini mushroom is a crown jewel of wild edibles. It thrives in the pine and oak forests of South Africa and is a prized find for any forager.</p>



        <div class="note">
            <strong>Did you know?</strong> If the growing conditions are perfect, Porcini can sometimes grow and weigh over 1KG per mushroom, all this can happen just overnight!

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cap:</strong> 10–30 cm, bread roll texture, tan to reddish-brown, white flesh that doesn't bruise.</li>
        <li><strong>Stipe (Stem):</strong> Thick, barrel-shaped with a fine white net pattern near the top, white and solid inside.</li>
        <li><strong>Pores (instead of gills):</strong> Cream when young, mustard yellow when mature, olive when old. No colour change when bruised.</li>
        <li><strong>Spore Print:</strong> Olive-brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Nutty and woody – one of the best ID tools.</li>

        <h2>How to Find</h2>
        <p>
            Finding porcini is as much about patience as it is about timing. In South Africa, they thrive in specific microclimates, and knowing when and where to look makes all the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Porcini mushrooms tend to appear 7–14 days after significant rainfall — typically 20mm or more — especially after a dry spell. They prefer the shoulder seasons: autumn and spring. During these months, warm days and cool nights create the perfect environment for fruiting.
        </p>
        <p>In the Western Cape and parts of Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, porcini are often found growing under pine plantations or oak trees, where the soil is well-drained and shaded. The mushroom’s growth is closely tied to introduced trees, such as:

            Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata), Cluster Pine (Pinus pinaster), English Oak (Quercus robur), Cork Oak (Quercus suber)</p>
        <p>A good forager learns to read the forest floor. Look for signs of moisture retention in the soil, leaf litter that hasn’t dried out, and the presence of moss. These are indicators that the mycelium underground might be active. If you catch the first flush, check your spot every 2–3 days. Porcini can grow fast — and decay fast.</p>
        <p>In high-yield pine plantations (especially those between 900–1500m altitude), commercial gatherers time their hunts around seasonal rains. If the hot berg winds don’t dry the forest too quickly, porcini can appear in great numbers.

            Some foragers say you can smell them before you see them — a woody, nutty fragrance carried by the damp forest air after rain.</p>

        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with the Trees: If you’re unfamiliar with porcini habitats, first learn to identify pine and oak trees. These trees are your best bet for finding porcini. If you’re under acacia, move on — porcini don’t grow in bushveld or fynbos zones.</li>
            <li>Know Your Sponge: The underside of the porcini cap has pores, not gills. When young, they’re creamy white; as they mature, they turn yellow and eventually olive green. Aim to pick firm mushrooms with white pores for the best eating quality.</li>
            <li>Look for Clues: A disturbed patch of moss, lifted leaves, or a slight bulge in the forest floor might indicate a mushroom breaking through. Experienced foragers often spot porcini before they fully emerge.</li>
            <li>Use Your Nose: A fresh porcini smells earthy, nutty, and slightly sweet. If it smells sour or unpleasant, it’s overripe or decomposing.</li>
            <li>Preserve the Best: Fresh porcini don’t last long. If you find more than you can eat, slice and dry them in a dehydrator or under sunlight. They rehydrate well and their umami-rich flavour deepens with drying.</li>
            <li>Check Frequently: Once a flush begins, return to the same area every 2–3 days. In ideal conditions, a new patch might emerge overnight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Be Cautious Of Lookalikes</h2>
        <p>
            The Bushveld bolete resembles porcini but grows under acacia in the bushveld — porcini don’t grow there.
